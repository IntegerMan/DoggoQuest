# Doggo Quest

Doggo Quest is small an Angular Interactive Fiction game created by Matt Eland as a teaching exercise to discuss:

- [Event Modeling](https://killalldefects.com/2020/02/01/game-design-with-event-modeling/)
- Angular
- Material UI
- TypeScript
- Jest
- NgRx
- Compromise-NLP

The game involves you as a small dog that gets loose in its house while its owners are away. The player gets a fixed number of turns to cause as much mayhem as they desire before the owners return. Chaos ensues.
