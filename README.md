# Doggo Quest

Doggo Quest is small an Angular Interactive Fiction game created by Matt Eland as a teaching exercise to discuss various topics:

- [Event Modeling](https://killalldefects.com/2020/02/01/game-design-with-event-modeling/)
- Angular
- Material UI
- TypeScript
- Jest
- NgRx
- Compromise-NLP

The game involves you as a small dog that gets loose in its house while its owners are away. The player gets a fixed number of turns to cause as much mayhem as they desire before the owners return. Chaos ensues.

## Availability

Doggo Quest is not yet hosted online, but will be at a later date.

### Event Modeling

I undertook an [exercise to use event modeling for game design](https://killalldefects.com/2020/02/01/game-design-with-event-modeling/) and the resulting graphic is included below:

### Puzzle Dependency Diagram

Additionally, I represented significant story beats in a [puzzle dependency diagram](http://thewebsiteisdown.com/twidblog/puzzle-dependency-graph-primer/) which is included below (Warning: Contains spoilers):
